            **Warning, bad practice 

            Angulars Flex slider plugin doesn't accept
            arrays of objects to be iterated within 
            flex-slide(smiliar to ng-repeat), so, what I did
            was store the required image url and image description 
            in a single element and use a javascript expression
            to split the data needed in order for the slider to take
            effect as show in ng-href, title, and ng-src attributes
        -->
        <flex-slider flex-slide="image in vm.businessAdImages" id="flex-custom">
            <li>       
                <a
                    activate-swipe-box
                    ng-href="{{image.split(',')[0]}}"
                    title="{{image.split(',')[1]}}"
                    class="swipebox"> 
                    <img ng-src="{{image.split(',')[0]}}" class="img-responsive" alt="{{image.split(',')[1]}}">

                </a>
            </li>
        </flex-slider>
